#MullvadScraper
Scraper made in python to find accounts on mullvad.net.
The auth method can also be used for other csrf protected websites.

##Download
Head on over to the [latest releases](https://github.com/diksm8/MullvadScraper/releases/latest) page and download either cx_Freeze.zip or py2exe.zip, unzip and run the exe.

##Disclaimer
If you run too many threads at once they will start to time out and the program will crash, burn and break. Please refrain from being an idiot since I am too much of one to fix this problem. You need to kill the python process if this happens.

##ToDo
I am done with this project. Feel free to bug me about it as much as you want but I won't fix shit.
