#MullvadScraper
Scraper made in python to find accounts on mullvad.net.
The auth method can also be used for other csrf protected websites.

##Disclaimer
If you run too many threads at once they will start to time out and the program will crash, burn and break. Please refrain from being an idiot since I am too much of one to fix this problem. You need to kill the python process if this happens.
